# Intro-to-Database-Systems-Design-CS4400-Fall2022
This is the repository for my final project in the course Intro to Database Systems at Georgia Tech.

# Final Project
In this project, our team developed a relational database using MySQL for the Restaurant Drone Delivery Express application. This database tracks transactions and inventory for restaurants using the application with a main goal of keeping a cost efficient stream of inventory based on customer demand.

There are three phases for this project:
In Phase I - We composed an Entity-Relationship-Diagram
In Phase II - Tables and constraints were created in MySQL and from there we inserted data pulled from the course directory
In Phase III - We implemented a list of stored procedures for the database
